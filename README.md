# Civil Servant Registry Service

## Purpose

Civil Servant Registry Service, aka 'CSRS' is a Spring Boot based RESTful API for managing user profile & personal data (e.g. name, grade, profession), linking users in line manager relationships, and holding organisation data (e.g. organisational units, parent/child orgs, agency tokens). Profile and org data is stored in MySQL. CSRS is called by LPG-UI and LPG-Management to view, create and update profile and organisation data, and is also called by most other API services to fetch profile data such as a user's line manager or organisation, or organisation relationships.

## Dependencies

### Build-time

For a complete list of build dependencies check the `build.gradle` file. The main source dependencies are:
- Spring Boot 2.0 (web, jetty, jersey, security, config)
- Spring Security OAuth2 2.3.3

### Test-time

For a complete list of test dependencies check the `build.gradle` file. The main test dependencies are:
- Spring Boot Starter Test
- Spring Boot Security Test
- mockito 2.8
- powermock 1.7

### Runtime

#### Other LPG Services

- `identity-service` for getting user identity details and creating service tokens to make inter-component requests

#### External integrations

- GOV.UK Notify to inform a user when they have been set as line manager by another user

#### Data Stores

- MySQL <version> for CRUD actions on civil servant profile and organisation data

#### Data migrations

The CSRS application uses Flyway to manage the DB migrations inside its own schema. See the `src/main/resources/db/migration` folder. Note: in-memory H2 DB has a separate migration folder than the deployed target MySQL DB - changes must be made to both in order to run successfully when deployed to the real environments.

#### Caching

The CSRS application is one of few application components in LPG that has explicit caching. 

The caching implemented is using the Spring `@Cacheable` annotation in the `OrganisationalUnitService` and `OrganisationalUnitRepository` classes, caching the results for flat and tree representations of organisations.
 
The cache is stored in a Redis instance configured in `application.yml`. Redis support for the cache is provided by the Spring Data Redis package which automatically provides Redis based caching for the `@Cacheable` annotation.
 
The cache is evicted on calls to save and delete in the `OrganisationalUnitRepository`.

Data is stored in the cache via Java default serialization. Any class needing to be cached must implement the java.io interface `Serializable`.

## Build, run, test, deploy

The application requires Java 8 (OpenJDK 8) installed to build and run.

Build the application using Gradle `./gradlew build`.

Run the project with `./gradlew bootRun` or import the project into your IDE of choice such as IntelliJ or VS Code use the IDE commands to Run Application.

Run the unit tests using `./gradlew test` or choose individual test classes or packages using your IDE.

The application is packaged as a docker container image and includes an Azure App Insights Java agent for collecting metrics from the app - see `Dockerfile` in the root directory for the container definition. `hammer` is the log collector used for aggregating log output.

The application also inclues a `Jenkinsfile` to define the Jenkins build pipeline stages and linking it to the docker image repository and correct terraform module.

Deployment is controlled via the Terraform scripts in the main PaaS repository, with per-environment configuration values referenced there and secrets injected from keybase.

## Configuration

Significant configuration properties are highlighted here. For the full configuration file see `src/main/resources/application.yml`

- `oauth` connection settings for the identity-service used to create auth tokens
- `spring.datasource` connection settings for MySQL database
- `govNotify` credentials and template reference for the GOV.UK client library
